To transition between two types of absolutely positioned content, you can use the [`<TransitionSeries>`](/docs/transitions/transitionseries) component.

```tsx twoslash title="SlideTransition.tsx"
import { AbsoluteFill } from "remotion";

const Letter: React.FC<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
  color: string;
}> = ({ children, color }) => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill
      style={{
        backgroundColor: color,
        opacity: 0.9,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        fontSize: 200,
        color: "white",
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
// ---cut---
import { linearTiming, TransitionSeries } from "@remotion/transitions";
import { slide } from "@remotion/transitions/slide";

const BasicTransition = () => {
  return (
    <TransitionSeries>
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={40}>
        <Letter color="#0b84f3">A</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
      <TransitionSeries.Transition
        presentation={slide()}
        timing={linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 30 })}
      />
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
        <Letter color="pink">B</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
    </TransitionSeries>
  );
};
```

<Demo type="slide" />

## Duration

In the above example, `A` is visible for 40 frames, `B` for 60 frames and the duration of the transition is 30 frames.  
During this time, both slides are rendered. This means the total duration of the animation is `60 + 40 - 30`.

<TransitionsDuration />

## Presentations and timings

A presentation determines the visual of animation.  
[Click here](/docs/transitions/presentations) to see the available presentations and how to create custom ones.

A timing determines how long the animation takes and the animation curve.  
[Click here](/docs/transitions/timings) to see the available timing presets and how to create custom ones.
