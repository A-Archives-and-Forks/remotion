## How to upgrade

See the [changelog](https://remotion.dev/changelog) to find the latest version.
Upgrade `remotion` and all packages starting with `@remotion` to the latest version, e.g. `5.0.0`:

```diff
- "remotion": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/bundler": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/eslint-config": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/cli": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/renderer": "4.0.141"
+ "remotion": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/bundler": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/eslint-config": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/cli": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/renderer": "5.0.0"
```

Run `npm i `, `yarn`, `pnpm i` or `bun i` respectively afterwards.

## Runtime requirements

The minimum Node version is now 18.0.0. The minimum Bun version is 1.1.3.

## `selectComposition()` and `getCompositions()` now require `inputProps`

`inputProps` is now required in [`selectComposition()`](/docs/renderer/select-composition) and [`getCompositions()`](/docs/renderer/get-compositions).  
A common footgun was the render was not working as intended because the input props were not passed.

**Required action**: Pass an empty object `{}` if you don't have any input props.

## `visualizeAudio()` yields different result

[`optimizeFor: "speed"`](/docs/visualize-audio#optimizefor) is now the default. This will yield slightly different results.

**Required action**: Review the visualization of your audio. If unsatisfactory, revert to the old behavior by setting `optimizeFor: "accuracy"`.
