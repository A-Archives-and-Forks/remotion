`@remotion/media-parser` works in the Browser, Node.js and Bun.  

However, all of these require some quite modern versions (considered modern as of August 2024).

## For parsing

For parsing a video, the following minimum versions are required:

- Node.js: 20.0.0
- Bun 1.0.0
- Chrome 111
- Edge 111
- Safari 16.4
- Firefox 128

## For using WebCodecs

WebCodecs support is not tied to `@remotion/media-parser` itself, but if you use it to extract samples, you need to use the following minimum versions:

- Chrome 94
- Edge 94
- Safari 16.4 - No support for `AudioDecoder`
- Firefox - No support, but in development

To check for `AudioDecoder` support, use

```ts
const audioDecoderSupported = typeof AudioDecoder !== 'undefined';
```

To check if a video track can be decoded with WebCodecs, use

```ts twoslash title="Checking if a video track can be decoded"
import {OnVideoTrack} from '@remotion/media-parser';

const onVideoTrack: OnVideoTrack = async (track) => {
  const {supported} = await VideoDecoder.isConfigSupported(track);

  if (!supported) {
    // Don't receive unsupported video samples
    return null;
  }

  return (videoSample) => {
    console.log('New video sample !', videoSample);
    // Accept video sample
  }
}
```


```ts twoslash title="Checking if a audio track can be decoded"
// @noErrors
import {OnAudioTrack} from '@remotion/media-parser';

const onAudioTrack: OnAudioTrack = async (track) => {
  const {supported} = await AudioDecoder.isConfigSupported(track);

  if (!supported) {
    // Don't receive unsupported audio samples
    return null;
  }

  return (audioSample) => {
    console.log('New audio sample!', audioSample);
    // Accept audio sample
  }
}
```
