# Caption<AvailableFrom v="4.0.216"/>

This is a simple data structure for a caption.

```tsx twoslash
import {Caption} from '@remotion/captions';
//      ^?
```

By establishing a standard data structure, we allow many operations that involve captions to be interoperable:

- Transcribing (using the [`@remotion/install-whisper-cpp`](/docs/install-whisper-cpp) package)
- Formatting (for example, creating pages using [`createTikTokStyleCaptions()`](/docs/captions/create-tiktok-style-captions))
- Parsing (using the [`parseSrt()`](/docs/captions/parse-srt) function)
- Serializing (for example to a .srt file)

## Fields

### `text`

The text of the caption.

### `startMs`

The start time of the caption in milliseconds.

### `endMs`

The end time of the caption in milliseconds.

### `timestampMs`

The timestamp of the caption as a singular timestamp in milliseconds.  
When using [`@remotion/install-whisper-cpp`](/docs/install-whisper-cpp), this the `t_dtw` value.  
Otherwise, it is not defined, but may be the average of the start and end timestamps.

### `confidence`

A number between 0 and 1 that indicates how confident the transcription is.
