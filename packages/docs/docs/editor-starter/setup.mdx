After obtaining the Editor Starter, you should [fork](https://github.com/remotion-dev/editor-starter/fork) it to your own account.

After cloning the repository, you can install the dependencies by running:

```
npm i
```

Run the app using:

```
npm run dev
```

The app may be deployed like any other React Router 7 app, for example by connecting the repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Setting up asset uploads

If the user drops in any assets, you can configure them to be uploaded to an S3 bucket. See [Asset uploads](/docs/editor-starter/asset-uploads) for more information.
