After obtaining the Editor Starter, you should [fork](https://github.com/remotion-dev/editor-starter/fork) it to your own account.

After cloning the repository, you can install the dependencies by running:

## Start a new project

If you are starting a new project, you can stay in your repository and install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Run the app using:

```
npm run dev
```

The app may be deployed like any other React Router 7 app, for example by connecting the repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Copying into an existing project

If you already have a project, you can copy the `src/editor` folder into your existing project.  
The following instructions were tested on a new Next.js project with Tailwind and TypeScript enabled, but it should work with any React framework.

    import { Editor } from "./editor/editor";

    export default function Home() {
      return <Editor />;
    }
    ```
