## Is this a video editor?

This is a starting point for building a video editor containing the essential features - it is meant to jumpstart someone else's mission of building a video editor!

## When should I buy the Editor Starter?

If you do not want to build your own interface from scratch, then consider buying the Editor Starter.

Read the [Before you buy](/docs/editor-starter/before-you-buy) section and make sure the answer to every question is "yes".

We think the Editor Starter is a great choice for starting your video editor, but there are other options that involve Remotion as well:  
You can also [build a video editor from scratch with Remotion](/docs/building-a-timeline), or buy another [Remotion-based video editor](/docs/buy-a-video-editor).

## Do I still need to obtain a Remotion License if I buy the Editor Starter?

Since the Editor Starter uses Remotion, you still need to obey by the [Remotion License](/docs/license).

In short: Teams and companies with a headcount of 4 or more need to obtain a Remotion License - read the license for more information.

## Can I integrate the Editor Starter into my existing app?

You should be able to copy one folder into your existing React project and get the frontend parts of the Editor Starter working out of the box.

We assume the most popular stack: React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS.  
Read the [Setup](/docs/editor-starter/setup) and [Dependencies](/docs/editor-starter/dependencies) sections to get a better idea of how to integrate the Editor Starter into your existing project.

## Should I buy the Timeline component or the Editor Starter?

The [Timeline](/docs/timeline) component is good if you are just requiring a timeline and would like to build the rest around it.

The Editor Starter also has a timeline, but also more features that are good to have in a video editor:

- Zoomable Canvas
- Captioning
- Exporting
- Asset uploading and local caching
- Font Picker
- Undo Stack

## I have bought the Timeline component, can I upgrade to the Editor Starter?

If you have already bought the [Timeline](/docs/timeline) and are buying the Editor Starter, you are eligible for a full refund on the Timeline component.  
Buy from the same email address and then contact us at [hi@remotion.dev](mailto:hi@remotion.dev) from the email address you used to buy the Timeline.

## Is Remotion launching its own video editor?

No - we hope to enable developers to launch their own products rather than entering the space ourselves.

### Why not?

From the beginning, we have only been focused on solving problems for developers.  
This is our distinct strength and we do not want to distract ourselves away from it.

Be aware: In order to launch a successful video editor, you need to invest a lot into marketing and communication.  
This is just not our strength, so launching a template allows us focus on our core competency: Video technology.
