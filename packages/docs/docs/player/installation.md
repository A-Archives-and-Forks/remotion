import {TableOfContents, PlayerGuide} from '../../components/TableOfContents/player';

To install the Player, run the following command in a React project:

<Installation />

Also update **all the other Remotion packages** to have the same version: `remotion`, `@remotion/cli` and others.

:::note
Make sure no package version number has a `^` character in front of it as it can lead to a version conflict.
