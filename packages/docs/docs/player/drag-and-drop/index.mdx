import {DragAndDropDemo} from './Demo';

The Remotion Player supports reacting to mouse events allowing for building interactions on the canvas.  
Try to drag and resize the elements below.

<DragAndDropDemo />
<br />
Pointer events work just like in regular React. Make these Remotion-specific
considerations:

- Disable the [`controls`](/docs/player/player#controls) prop to disable any obstructing elements. You can render Playback controls [outside of the Player](/docs/player/custom-controls).
- The Player might have CSS `scale()` applied to it.  
  [If you measure elements](/docs/measuring), you need to divide by the scale obtained by [`useCurrentScale()`](/docs/use-current-scale).
- You can pass state update functions via [`inputProps`](/docs/player/player#inputprops) to the Player. Alternatively, using React Context also works.

## Example

Let's build the demo above.
