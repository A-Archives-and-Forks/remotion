You may want to implement custom controls for the [`<Player>`](/docs/player/player) component.

There are two approaches:

- Enable the [`controls`](/docs/player/player#controls) prop and granunarly override some or all of the controls inside the Player.
- Disable the [`controls`](/docs/player/player#controls) prop and implement your own controls anywhere on the page.

## Custom inline controls

Use this approach if you:

- Like the default controls but want to customize some of them
- Want the controls to overlay the Player.

Ensure the [`controls`](/docs/player/player#controls) prop is set in the [`<Player/>`](/docs/player/player).  
Use the following APIs to customize the individual controls:

- [`renderPlayPauseButton()`](/docs/player/player#renderplaypausebutton)
- [`renderFullscreenButton()`](/docs/player/player#renderfullscreenbutton)
- [`renderMuteButton()`](/docs/player/player#rendermutebutton)
- [`renderVolumeSlider()`](/docs/player/player#rendervolumeslider)

## Controls outside the Player

Use this approach if you:

- Want to implement custom controls anywhere on the page
- Want full controls over the look and behavior of the controls

Ensure the [`controls`](/docs/player/player#controls) prop is not set in the [`<Player/>`](/docs/player/player).  
Obtain a [`ref`](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) of type `PlayerRef` of the [`<Player/>`](/docs/player/player) and use the following starting points to implement your own controls:

### Play / Pause button

```tsx twoslash
import type {PlayerRef} from '@remotion/player';
import React, {SVGProps, useCallback, useEffect} from 'react';

export const PlayPauseButton: React.FC<{
  playerRef: React.RefObject<PlayerRef>;
}> = ({playerRef}) => {
  const [playing, setPlaying] = React.useState(
    () => playerRef.current?.isPlaying() ?? false,
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    const {current} = playerRef;
    if (!current) {
      return;
    }

    const onPlay = () => {
      setPlaying(true);
    };

    const onPause = () => {
      setPlaying(false);
    };

    current.addEventListener('play', onPlay);
    current.addEventListener('pause', onPause);

    return () => {
      current.removeEventListener('play', onPlay);
      current.removeEventListener('pause', onPause);
    };
  }, [playerRef]);

  const onToggle = useCallback(() => {
    playerRef.current?.toggle();
  }, [playerRef]);

  return (
    <button onClick={onToggle} type="button">
      {playing ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
    </button>
  );
};
```

The [buffering indicator](/docs/player/buffer-state) is not implemented in this snippet.
