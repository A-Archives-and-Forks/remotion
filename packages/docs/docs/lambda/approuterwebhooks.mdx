Simplifies the process of setting up Remotion Lambda Client in your Next.js app which is using App Router. Refer to [pagesRouterWebhooks()](/docs/lambda/pagerouterwebhooks) for doing the same in apps using Pages Router.
## API

The function accepts an object with six key-value pairs:

### `secret`

Your webhook secret, must be a `string`

### `testing`

Whether or not to allow requests intending to test the endpoint, useful while using Webhook endpoint tester on [Webhooks Page](/docs/lambda/webhooks). Should be a `boolean`.

### `extraHeaders`

Add your own custom headers to the outgoing response. Provide key-value pairs where both the key and value are strings.


### `onSuccess()`

A function that is called with a `Payload` object as an argument when the incoming request indicates a successful event.

### `onError()`

A function that is called with a `Payload` object as an argument when the incoming request indicates an error.

### `onTimeout()`

A function that is called with a `Payload` object as an argument when the incoming request indicates a timeout.


## Example

Setting up a webhook endpoint in a Next.js app which uses App Router. This will listen on the endpoint: `mydomain.com/api`


```tsx twoslash title="app/api/route.ts"
import {
  appRouterWebhooks
} from '@remotion/lambda/client';
 
export const POST = appRouterWebhooks(
  {
    secret: 'mysecret', 
    testing: true,
    extraHeaders: {
      "region" : 'south-asia'
    },
    onSuccess: () => (console.log("Rendering Completed Successfully")),
    onError: () => (console.log("Something went wrong while rendering")),
    onTimeout: () => (console.log("Timeout occured while rendering"))
  }
)
 
export const OPTIONS = POST;
```

See [Webhooks](/docs/lambda/webhooks) for an Express example.
