Unlike normal websites, a video has fixed dimensions. That means, it is okay to use `position: "absolute"`!

In Remotion, you often want to "layer" elements on top of each other.  
This is a common pattern in video editors, and in Photoshop.

An easy way to do it is using the [`<AbsoluteFill>`](/docs/absolute-fill) component:

```tsx twoslash title="MyComp.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { AbsoluteFill, Img, staticFile } from "remotion";

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <AbsoluteFill>
        <Img src={staticFile("bg.png")} />
      </AbsoluteFill>
      <AbsoluteFill>
        <h1>This text appears on top of the video!</h1>
      </AbsoluteFill>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

This will render the text on top of the image.
