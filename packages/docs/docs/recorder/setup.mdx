# Setup

After you got access to the repo, [create a fork](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder/fork) of it.

ℹ️ You need to make your fork **private** to not leak the source code of the Remotion Recorder.

Clone your fork and install dependencies using:

## Install Bun

The Remotion Recorder requires [bun](https://bun.sh/). To install it, run

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Install dependencies

Once bun is installed, run

```bash
bun i
```

to install all the neccessary dependencies.

## Create a new video

In `src/Root.tsx` you have an empty `<Composition>`.  
Duplicate the composition component and give it a different ID.

In `copy-from-downloads.mjs`, set the prefix to the ID of the `<Composition>` you just cloned.

```js filename="copy-from-downloads.tss"
const prefix = "<your-composition-id>";
```

This ensures the recorded files to be correctly copied to the right folder after recording them.
