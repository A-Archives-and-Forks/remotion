# Examples

If you buy the Remotion Recorder, you will get access to [`JonnyBurger/my-recorder`](https://github.com/JonnyBurger/my-recorder).  
This is Jonny's instance of the Recorder and is the repo being used to create his and Remotion's videos.

This repository may have more and newer features, but it is not guaranteed to be stable.  
Use it as a reference if you wonder how we made a specific video!
