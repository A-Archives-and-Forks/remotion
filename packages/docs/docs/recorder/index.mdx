The Remotion Recorder is a [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) template for producing screencast videos for social media.

**Responsive**: Record once and export in both 16:9 as well as 1:1 aspect ratio.  
**Hackable**: It ships as Remotion source code, so you can customize everything: the colors, layout, animations and much more.  
**Clean**: A clear layout perfectly positioning your facecam, screen and captions.

## Features

Additionally, record up to two other sources at the same time for multicam setups.
