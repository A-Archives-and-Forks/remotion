# Render on lambda

If you want to render long videos faster or you want to render different versions of your videos at the same time (e.g., for different platforms or different formats), you can take advantage of [@remotion/lambda](/docs/lambda).

## Setup lambda

First you need to set up Remotion Lambda. Follow the step 1 to and including step 7 of the instructions shown [here](/docs/lambda/setup).

## Deploy and render

Add the following function and site deployment commands as well as the render command into a shell script you can execute each time you want to render a video:

```shell
bunx remotion lambda functions deploy --timeout=3000
bunx remotion lambda sites create --site-name=<your-site-name> --enable-folder-expire
bunx remotion lambda render <your-serve-url> <composition-id> --log=verbose --delete-after="1-day"
```

If you want to render different videos at the same time you can add render commands and change specific props to fit your needs.

For exmaple if you want to render your video for YouTube, X, and Instagram, your shell script could look like this:

```shell
bunx remotion lambda functions deploy --timeout=3000
bunx remotion lambda sites create --site-name=<your-site-name> --enable-folder-expire
bunx remotion lambda render --props='{"platform": "youtube"}' <your-serve-url> <composition-id> --log=verbose --delete-after="1-day"
bunx remotion lambda render --props='{"platform": "x"}' <your-serve-url> <composition-id> --log=verbose --delete-after="1-day"
bunx remotion lambda render --props='{"platform": "instagram"}' <your-serve-url> <composition-id> --log=verbose --delete-after="1-day"
```
