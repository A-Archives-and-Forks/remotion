This page aims to collect experiments and hacks that were made to the Remotion Recorder

## Swear word detection

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UurGWCLRuEI) is a demonstration by [Matt McGillivray](https://www.remotion.dev/experts/matthew-mcgillivray) of how swear words can be automatically censored and replaced with a sound effect.

## AI audio enhancement

Another experiment by [Matt McGillivray](https://www.remotion.dev/experts/matthew-mcgillivray) is [this one](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-mcgillivray-68295a55_aicoustics-takes-my-very-modest-recording-activity-7363434985233543171-2XQ_) where he uses the ai|coustics API to enhance the audio of his recording.

## Code Hike integration

In a [branch](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder/pull/123), we experimented with using Code snippets instead of videos as a source for the display.
