# Add background music

To add background music, you first have to add songs to the `public/sounds` folder.  
Then register the track in `remotion/layout/music.ts`.

```tsx filename="remotion/layout/music.ts"
export const music = z.enum([
  "previous",
  "none",
  "somesong",
  // You can give your song any label. This is the name you will see in the editor.
  "<your-song-label>",
]);

export const getAudioSource = (track: Music) => {
  if (track === "somesong") {
    return staticFile("sounds/soundtrack1.mp3");
  }

  // Add your track here. The label has to match the one you added above.
  if (track === "<your-song-label>") {
    return staticFile("sounds/<actual-asset-name>");
  }
};
```

You can now apply the newly added music to a scene by selecting the track in the right sidebar.

## Changing music

Music will automatically carry over to the next scene.  
If you want to change the music, select a different track for a scene and it will crossfade.

## Stopping music

If you want to stop the music, select `none` as track.
