## Correct

If the AI has made a mistake in the caption, inside the Remotion Studio you can correct it by clicking on the faulty subtitle in the video. This opens a text editor containing the subtitles, from where you can directly edit them.
Once you are done with your corrections, click on "Done" in the right bottom corner of the editor. This will save the changes you made into the JSON file containing your subtitles.
Alternativel, you can directly edit your JSON files located at `public/<your-composition-id>` in your project with an editor of your choice.

## Highlight Words

To highlight specific words, click on the desired word within the subtitles. In the opening editor, choose the `monospace` option to apply a monospaced font and default blue color to the selected word.
If you wish to change the highlighting color, modify the `WORD_HIGHLIGHT_COLOR` constant in the `colors.ts` file.
