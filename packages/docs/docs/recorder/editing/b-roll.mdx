# B-roll

You can overlay your recorded scenes with additional video or photo footage by adding b-roll elements in the right sidebar.

Add the footage you want to use to the public folder and select it from the b-roll drop-down menu for the scene you want to overlay.

Configure when and for how long to play an asset by adjusting the `from` and `durationInFrames` values.
The `from` value is relative to the scene you are adding the b-roll to and defines the frame after which the asset should be displayed.
