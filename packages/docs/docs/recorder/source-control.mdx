# Source Control

The recomended way of managing changes in your project is by using git.
To handle the large assets that are accumulated in your projects public folder when recording, two different approaches are suggested.

### Approach 1: Add public folder to .gitignore

Add the public folder containing all your assets to the .gitignore file by running

```bash
echo "public" > .gitignore
```

from your projects root directory.
This prevents all the assets in your public folder from being added to your git repository, where they could otherwise lead it to quickly use up all its available space.

| Pro                  | Contra                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Simple to use        | Videos are kept locally |
| No additional costs  |                         |
| Easy to pull updates |                         |

### Approach 2: Use Git LFS

If you want to keep track of all your videos in the repository, you can use Git LFS. This allows you to store recorded videos in a separate storage and only store a reference to the video in the repository.

| Pro                                         | Contra                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| All videos are referenced in the repository | Extra costs for storage        |
| Videos are stored online                    | Additional installation needed |
|                                             | Difficult to pull updates      |

While a certain amount of storage is usually included, additional storage space for Git LFS has to be purchased separately.

#### Setup Git LFS

1. Download Git LFS. You can find the instructions [here](https://git-lfs.com/)
2. Initialize Git LFS in your repository by running

```bash
    git lfs install
```

from the root folder of the cloned project.

3. Configure Git LFS to track all .mp4 files located in the /public and all its subfolders by running

```bash
    git lfs track public/**/*.mp4
```

If you used up all your available storage capacity and monthly bandwith quota, you can purchase additional datapacks on on GitHub by following the steps listed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/upgrading-git-large-file-storage).
