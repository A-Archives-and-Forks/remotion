## Prerequisites

The Remotion CLI is required for this. 

There is no difference in the following commands.

Run one of the following commands in the root of the project you want to upgrade:

<Tabs
defaultValue="npx"
values={[
{ label: 'npx', value: 'npx', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'bunx', value: 'bunx', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npx">

```bash
npx remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm exec remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="bunx">

```bash
bunx remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Make sure that all remotion packages use the same version.

You can delete the ^ in front of the version number in your package.json in order to prevent auto updates
