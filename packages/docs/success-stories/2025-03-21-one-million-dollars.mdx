We look at and root for the people that build stuff with Remotion all the time.
Every once in a while, we come across some astounding success stories out of the blue!

Here are 5 examples of projects that really took off and became incredibly successful in a short amount of time – we're talking millions.

We are just including projects that are open about using Remotion, and that have posted publicly about their revenue. While we cannot verify them, we'll link their claims.

## Submagic - a million per year after 3 months

The rise of [Submagic](https://www.submagic.co/), an AI shorts tool has been nothing but mesmerizing.

[According to them](https://x.com/elieln_/status/1824925166012448973), they reached $1M ARR (annual recurring revenue) only 3 months after launching – that was in August of 2024.

Probably they've moved on way beyond that point now, as they've amassed over 3 million users by now with smart marketing, a sharp pitch and a simple to use, polished product.

## Crayo.ai - $6M per year with video stories

Promoting to the massive audience of influencer [Musa Mustafa](https://www.instagram.com/mussy.02), he and [Aleem Rehmtulla](https://x.com/aleemrehmtulla) managed to turn their video stories generator [Crayo](https://crayo.ai) into a huge business quickly after launching it.

When financial success changes your life quickly, you're not safe from conflicts. [That's how we heard](https://x.com/musamanzz/status/1891059361943863338) about how big the business actually is - generating over half a million dollars per month.

Looking over the drama, we are impressed what the teenage founders manage to build and achieve in such a short time. With over 2 million users, they found traction that goes beyond way just the audience they had initially.

## AIVideo.com - $1M per year

Focusing on creating professional quality videos using AI, [AIVideo.com](https://aivideo.com) reached the magic milestone of [$1 million revenue](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308525123269971969/) per year in less than a year.

We like that they don't just focus on shorts, but lengthy landscape videos and that they manage to actually make the quality good!

Congrats to them on building a product that sticks!

## Icon.me - The viral $5M ARR Ad Maker

Icon first caught our attention only just about when they launched their product with a [brilliant intro video](https://x.com/kennandavison/status/1886836061378372064) that went extremely viral.

Since then, they had an unstoppable rise and crossed the $5M annual recurring revenue barrier in just - hold your breath - 30 days.

That's probably the record for how quickly a Remotion product has grown. We bow to Icon!

## Ossa.ai - half a million text-to-video generator

Finally, there's [Ossa](https://ossa.ai) - the startup by [influencer Cole Gonzales](https://www.instagram.com/colewherld/) which focuses on turning text into engaging video.

<img src="/img/ossa.png" />

They [posted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cole-gonzales_heres-how-i-grew-my-bootstrapped-tech-startup-activity-7206735885839532035-mdgM/) that they have reached $500K annual recurring revenue per year which, granted, does not fit the title of this post. But, it's been 9 months since then, so if they kept growing then it's not unlikely they are also in the 7 figure club now.

## You can build with Remotion too!

We cannot help you with the business side of starting a product - actually if we knew how big it can go, we'd have been more business-savvy with our [licensing](https://remotion.pro/license)!

However, we can provide you with a solid foundation for starting your video app.  
These companies all have one thing in common: They use the same tools that we make available to you as well.

We help them on our support channels just like we help you when you need technical help. You'd be surprised how little communication we have with some of these companies and how much they achieve just off the things we put out in public.

Start your idea today with [`npx create-video@latest`](/docs) – we are rooting for your success.
