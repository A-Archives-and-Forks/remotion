---

import {MuxVideo} from '../src/components/MuxVideo';

[Shortvid.io](https://shortvid.io) is an open source project that expose a set of Remotion customisable composition for event communication assets under MIT license.

We are talking to Antoine Caron and Mickael Alves about how they are using Remotion to generate video content to let them communicate about there meetup events.

**Hi! Tell us about Shortvid, how does this project start and why?**

- Authors were Remotion users and contributors
- At first, it was just a project for the LyonJS meetup
- We are often speaking at conferences and sometime about Remotion
- Maybe those videos template could be useful for other conferences event

**And somehow, it became bigger than what you thought at first?**

- we started with Touraine Tech event
- But you can find out many tech events showcases in our website, event with which we are in partnership
- Then lately we had discussion with GDG Nantes event

**What is Devfest Nantes conference?**

- One of the biggest tech event in france
  - more than 3K attendes
- in Nantes
- Already 11 editions

**How did the GDG Nantes team used Shortvid.io?**

- video to announce speakers talks on social media
- TV screen all over the conference hall
- It has somehow help us motivate to do another contribution in Remotion for a request we had for Devfest nantes

**What are the next steps for shortvid?**

- We will continue to add more templates in the futur and help tech events that want to work with us.
- Mickael is working on integrating Zod scheme
- Antoine is looking to deploy directly playground of Remotion under shortvid website
- Next year will be bigger for Shortvid and Devfest Nantes
- We will try to motivate Jonny to come to Nantes to talk about Remotion Adventure maybe !
